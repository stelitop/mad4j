 * <p>Annotation used for creating command requirements that limit when a command can be used.

 * of the requirement.</p>
 *
 * <p>The implementation of the requirement must be a class that has a Spring bean
 * and implement the {@link CommandRequirementExecutor} interface. A regular {@link Component} works.</p>
 *
 * <p>The annotation that would represent the requirement needs the {@link CommandRequirement} annotation
